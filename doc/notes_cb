TODO
    log.py
        how / under which conditions is it possible to log date/time
        maybe, if possible, turn sniff function inside out (manage main loop)
        maybe import logging instead of print
    .gitignore
    read scapy docs: what else is in the packets (==> application ideas)
    set up distributed logging concept with sql databases
    extract config/setup script from "first steps" (see below)
    [personal] get and learn meld (git mergetool)

DONE
    cleanup log.py
        f_dump not global
        no magic numbers
        self-documenting code
        docstrings (with TODOs)
        PEP-8
        logfile overwrite option
        autocreate data directory
